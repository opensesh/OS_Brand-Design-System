# Open Session Brand Design System

## 🌐 Bridging Design & Development

An open-source playground where designers can explore code and developers can discover design. We believe in building in public and sharing knowledge across disciplines.

This is the complete brand design system for Open Session, made public for anyone to learn from, fork, and experiment with. Whether you're a designer wanting to understand how design systems translate to code, or a developer curious about design thinking and Figma workflows, this repository serves as your bridge.

## 🎨 Design Foundation

Our Figma file (available on the Open Session Community page) features:
- Global & semantic variables for scalability
- Responsive typography across all viewports  
- Container breakpoints for modern responsive design
- Systematic spacing & sizing based on mathematical scales
- Design tokens exported via Token Studio plugin
