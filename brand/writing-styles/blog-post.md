## Example Opening (Substack)

```
Yesterday, Anthropic dropped MCP. 

We immediately canceled our meetings and spent 6 hours building with it.

Here's what every designer needs to know: MCP isn't just another tool‚Äîit's the 
bridge between your Figma files and production code that we've been waiting for.
```

## Example Opening (Medium/Blog)

```
The Problem with Modern Design Systems

Last week, a creative director at a $10M startup told us something we hear 
constantly: "My team spends 60% of their time on updates, not innovation."

We've been there. At Google, we watched teams struggle with the same challenge. 
But here's what changed everything: treating design systems as living, 
AI-powered organisms rather than static libraries.
```

## Questions to Ask Before Writing

1. "Which platform is this for?"
2. "Should I include code examples?"
3. "Do you have a relevant client story or personal anecdote?"
4. "Want me to suggest image placement?"
5. "Is this based on a recent experiment or broader analysis?"
